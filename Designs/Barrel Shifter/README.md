# Bit Shifting Block Implemented with Barrel Shifters

A barrel shifter is a specialized digital electronic circuit with the purpose of shifting an entire data word by a specified number of bits by only using combinational logic, 
with no sequential logic used.

The Simplest way to implementing this desigs was using Multiplexers in a specific manner that depends on the amount of shift specified.
